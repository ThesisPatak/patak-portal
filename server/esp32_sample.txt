ESP32 pairing and heartbeat example (pseudocode)

- On first boot generate deviceId and deviceKey and store in NVS.
- Show QR containing JSON: { "deviceId": "<id>", "deviceKey": "<key>" }

HTTP heartbeat example (Arduino-style pseudocode):

POST /devices/heartbeat
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "deviceId": "my-device-123",
  "deviceKey": "super-secret-generated-on-device"
}

Server will create or update the device record and set lastSeen and lastIP.

Pairing via mobile/web:
- Mobile scans the QR and sends POST /devices/register with user JWT and the same payload.
- Server will bind the device to the user account if unclaimed.

Security notes:
- In production, use TLS and avoid sending raw deviceKey repeatedly; instead exchange a short-lived token after initial onboarding.
